To connect the code to your bot, head to the config.json and fill in the token and prefix option with the appropiate data, here's an example below:

Unsure on where to get the token? https://discord.com/developers/applications
```json
{
    "token": "eUzMjc0gY2ODyEweyMzcz.YqS_9Q.307ekqvMjRz7efHkmeJs", 
    "prefix": "%"
}
```
(That token is not valid so don't try and use it)
  
To install the required libraries for the project, use the following commands:
```
npm init -y
npm i discord.js
npm i sqlite3.0.0
```
The DB used is sqlite but feel free to change this as you please!
  
If you would like to change the pokemon feel free to in pokedex.json. Please keep in mind the max amount of roles in a server is 200.
  
Currently the bot is extremely lackluster but will be developed further in future, enjoy what i've got so far!
