<h1>NovaPokedex</h1>
An Open Source Discord Bot For A Pokemon Style Game!


<u>Terms Of Service<u>
- You may not use this bot for financial gain.
- You may not claim the bot as your own.
  
  
<h2>Info</h2>

Disclaimer: Multiple confidential + node.js files are hidden. Copy and pasting the code WILL NOT make the bot work. 

A config.json file and a preferences.db database in /databases are required
  
The config should look like this:
```json
{
    "token": "yourBotTokenHere",
    "prefix": "yourCommandPrefixHere"
}
```
  
The bot uses SQLite as a DB and discord.js for making requests to the Discord API, feel free to edit these as you please.
  
To make the application, enter these node commands:
```
npm init -y
npm i discord.js
npm i sqlite3.0.0
```
  
Currently the bot is extremely lackluster but will be developped further in future, enjoy what i've got so far!
